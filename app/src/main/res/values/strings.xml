    <string name="game_rules">Rules of the game: there will be three figures in front of you, two from the bottom and one from the top, two of them will have numbers. It is necessary that the sum of the numbers from the two lower figures is equal to the number in the upper figure. To do this, insert the missing number.

Example: in the upper circle there is a number 7, in one of them there is a question mark, and in the other there is a number 4. So there should be a number 3 in place of the Question mark, because 3 + 4 = 7.</string>
